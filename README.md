# PTV_SYN


I followed these steps: 
https://help.github.com/en/articles/importing-a-git-repository-using-the-command-line

and got it to import with the commits

I will add all the additional files I made for PTV soon. Studying for an exam :/

Todo:
Make output 8bit images in the format ready for ptv (remove header and number seq), currently 16 bit.
