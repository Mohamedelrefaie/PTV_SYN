# PTV_SYN

This code was developed with the help of matthew giarra. The initial base source code for image generation can be found here: https://github.com/matthewgiarra/piv-image-gen-multicam

This is the latest branch and will be used as the master. 

I organized it, removed junk and added robust functions. 

Tutorial for JHU and Burgers. 

Will be the version that generates the final set of data.
