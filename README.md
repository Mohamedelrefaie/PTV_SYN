# PTV_SYN

A software for generating multi camera particle images for 3D Particle Tracking Velocimetry. This suit will generate a complete working folder for which PyPTV can process. For each camera, the software will generate the calibration image, calibration file, and sequence of particle images. 

This code was developed with the help of matthew giarra. The initial base source code for image generation can be found here: https://github.com/matthewgiarra/piv-image-gen-multicam

This is the latest branch and will be used as the master. 

I organized it, removed junk and added robust functions. 

Tutorial for JHU turbuelence data and analytical Burgers vortex are included.

Will be the version that generates the final set of data.
