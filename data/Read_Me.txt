Files:

traj_GT:
-These are the ground truth trajectories from JHU database supplied by Dr.Lib
-These where generated by converted from the JHU mat file to the trajectory format PTV uses. 
-Number of trajectories = 100 
-These are the same trajectories that were supplied to the image generator
-I would work with these, develop the codes then apply them to the Reconstructed PTV trajectories
- dt = 1/100

traj_RC:
- Reconstructed trajectories using PTV. 
- dt = 1/100


These trajectories should work with all PTV codes.
